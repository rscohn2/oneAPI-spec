Roles
=====

Each oneAPI element has a **core team** and **lead** who are the primary
authors for the specification. The community is invited to make
feature requests or proposals, which are reviewed by the core team.

The overall specification also has a core team and lead. The **oneAPI
core team** is responsible for issues that involve multiple oneAPI
elements and provides general oversight.

**Technical advisory boards** review topics related to specifications and
provide feedback. There may be overlap between core team and technical
advisory board.


Decision Making
===============

Specification changes and other decisions are by consensus of a core
team. The lead determines if consensus has been reached and what
action to take when there is no consensus. Decision making must
balance the needs of the community, including: technical advisory
boards, implementations, and users. Decision making will be
transparent, with clear explanations and constructive feedback for
rejected proposals.


Membership
==========

A core team can decide to add new members or designate a new
lead. Members will typically have a history of contribution to the
specification, contribution to an implementation, or as a end-user of
an implementation. Membership is open to all companies, institutions,
and implementations.

Commit Rights
=============

Committers follow the direction of the core team. Core teams decide
who has commit rights to the repository.

Governance Changes
==================

Governance is intended to be informal and low overhead while
encouraging broad participation from the community. oneAPI core team
may change governance as the community evolves.


Code of Conduct
===============

We follow [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Contact
[oneapi@intel.com](mailto:oneapi@intel.com) or a team lead with
questions or to report an issue.
